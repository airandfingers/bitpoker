        <h1> Bitcoin Information</h1>

       <h2> Short background on bitcoins</h2>
        <div> effectively digital cash-as of late January 2013, about 17 USD for 1 Bitcoin-bitcoins are to USD (or other traditional currency) as Bittorrent is to downloading from a server-unforgiving, strict, virtually untraceable, and currency supply is auto-regulated (currency caps at 21million bitcoins, but coins are divisible)-no central bank can ever print more bitcoins because they feel like it-no regulation on transfers (no payment processors needed)-

        <h2> What makes this special/why would people come (and pay) to use this service? </h2>
        <ul>
         <li><h3>true anonymity</h3></li>
            <ul>
         <li>players do not need to give their name, or any identifying information</li>
         <li>players do not even need to give an email (though they probably should for password recovery)</li>
            </ul>
         <li>-safety (instant deposit/withdrawal)</li>
         <li>-anonymous, and therefore, “effectively legal” in whatever country of residence player is playing from</li>
         <li>-anal players can cash out immediately when finished, and deposit prior to playing, much like a livecasino where one would buy chips, play at the tables, then get cash for the chips prior to leaving</li>
         <li>-players do not need to worry that the poker site might “go under,” as there is little to no oversight on withdrawals, so they do not need to store money on the site if they do not want.</li>
         <li>-legality and corresponding illegality/inability of banks to transact payments for poker sites makes this a service USA players desperately need and are seeking-Americans have no good way to play poker right now (some have even moved to foreign countries)-VPN's cannot be used to play online poker from the USA, because the player still needs a foreign bank account to deposit money from, bitcoins solve this problem-USA players are owed over $100M from Full Tilt Poker alone (does not count Pokerstars), and arecurrently not able to play online poker. There is a huge, untapped market out there.-low rake-poker sites such as FTP and PS had to pay payment processors to process player deposits, and makethis up in rake, with no fees, operating expenses are reduced
